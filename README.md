# HazeBot üåø

A Discord bot designed for The Chillventory server ("Haze" on Discord). Built with Python and discord.py, HazeBot enhances moderation, onboarding, changelogs, and community engagement with a modular, inventory-themed experience.

**Note:** This is a personal project. Feel free to fork and adapt it for your own server!

---

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Special Architecture Notes

- **Test & Production Mode:** The bot automatically detects via the `PROD_MODE` environment variable whether it is running in test or production mode. IDs and tokens are dynamically loaded from `.env` and managed in `Config.py`, allowing safe operation in multiple environments.
- **Rich Logging:** All logs are output with colored emojis and highlights using the `rich` framework (`Utils/Logger.py`). This makes debugging and monitoring in the terminal much easier.
- **Caching Strategies:** The bot uses both in-memory and file-based caching (`Utils/CacheUtils.py`). Frequently used data (e.g., activity, moderation data, API responses) is cached with a configurable TTL to optimize performance and avoid rate limits.
- **AI Features:** For changelog and to-do formatting, the bot uses OpenAI GPT-4.1-Nano models.
